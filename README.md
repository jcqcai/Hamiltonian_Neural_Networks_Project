# Hamiltonian_Neural_Networks_Project

In this project, I replicate and extend some of the results of "Hamiltonian Neural Networks" by Greydanus, S. et al., modifying the original code to accomodate both multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Specifically, I compare the performance of a KAN-based Hamiltonian Neural Network (HNN) against the original MLP-based HNN when predicting the dynamics of a spring-mass oscillator system. Ultimately, the KAN-based HNN outperformed the MLP-based HNN in all aspects. Additionally, the KAN-based HNN had the added benefit that it was able to be used to extract the exact symbolic solution of the Hamiltonian of the system, thus supporting the claim from the original KAN paper that one of the main benefits of KANs is their high level of interpretability.
